# You Are What You Listen To: a podcast tracker

We believe that tracking podcasts, and find more that you enjoy, should be an easy endeavor. This fullstack application was built with React, NodeJS and mongoDB.

## How to use this project:
- Once you've made your way to the website use the Register link to create a profile and become a user.
- If you're unsure that you need to become a user, perhaps your still browsing, you're welcome to do so on the Search page. There you can look for your favorite podcasts by name and look for additional episodes that may be interesting to you. 
- Once you've registered, you'll be taken to the Login page where you'll get to use your new, fancy login credentials. Now that you're signed in, you're able to save podcasts that you'd like to listen to and ones that you've already listened to. This allows you to see which shows you're following, so you can easily begin listening to those episodes. You can also quickly view the episodes you've already listened to.
- When you're finished with your session, we suggest logging out using the Logout option on the navigation bar.
